## 📖 Overview

MouseWiggler is a hardware solution that automatically detects room lighting conditions using a photocell sensor and intelligently controls mouse movement to prevent screen savers. Unlike simple timer-based wigglers, this project uses a sophisticated **dual-criteria rate-of-change detection algorithm** to distinguish between:

- ✅ **Sudden changes** (light switch on/off) → Triggers wiggle enable/disable
- ❌ **Gradual changes** (sunrise, sunset, clouds) → Ignored

This ensures the system responds to intentional lighting changes while ignoring natural ambient light variations.

## 🎯 Features

- **Intelligent Light Detection**: Dual-criteria algorithm filters gradual ambient changes
- **Randomized Wiggle Pattern**: Variable timing and direction to evade monitoring software detection
- **Minimal Mouse Movement**: Imperceptible ±1 pixel movements prevent screen saver activation
- **Visual Indicator**: Optional LED shows when wiggling is active
- **Interrupt-Driven**: Efficient timer-based architecture with no polling
- **Tunable Parameters**: Easy-to-adjust thresholds for different environments
- **Well-Documented**: Complete Doxygen documentation with detailed algorithm explanations

## 💡 How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

The system uses a **dual-criteria approach** to detect meaningful light changes:

1. **Signal Averaging**: Continuously samples the photocell at 100 Hz, averaging 100 samples per second
2. **Percentage Change**: Calculates immediate change from previous measurement
3. **Rate of Change**: Tracks change velocity over a 5-second history window
4. **Dual Criteria**: Requires BOTH conditions to trigger state change:
   - **Magnitude**: Change > 15% (configurable via `SUDDEN_CHANGE_THRESHOLD`)
   - **Rate**: Rate > 5% per sample period (configurable via `CHANGE_RATE_THRESHOLD`)

### Example Scenarios

| Scenario         | Magnitude | Rate     | Action                   |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Light switch ON  | High      | High     | ✅ Enable wiggling        |
| Light switch OFF | High      | High     | ✅ Disable wiggling       |
| Sunset/Sunrise   | High      | Low      | ❌ Ignore (gradual)       |
| Clouds passing   | Medium    | Low      | ❌ Ignore (gradual)       |
| Random noise     | Low       | Variable | ❌ Ignore (insignificant) |

### Mouse Wiggle Pattern

When lights are detected, the system performs randomized movements to evade detection:

**Timing Randomization:**
- Base period: 10 seconds (configurable via `wigglePeriod`)
- Random variation: ±3 seconds (configurable via `wigglePeriodVariation`)
- Actual wiggle interval: 7-13 seconds (randomly varies each time)
- Minimum enforced period: 3 seconds

**Movement Randomization:**
- Randomly selects one of four diagonal directions: (+1,+1), (+1,-1), (-1,+1), or (-1,-1)
- Immediately reverses the movement to return cursor to original position
- Direction changes randomly with each wiggle

**Benefits:**
- Timing variation prevents pattern recognition by monitoring software
- Random directions avoid predictable movement signatures
- Net effect: cursor returns to original position (invisible to user)
- Result: Screen saver prevented while evading automated detection

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Arduino IDE** - [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - TimerOne
   - TimerThree
   - Mouse (built-in with Arduino HID boards)

### Install Libraries

```bash
# Via Arduino IDE Library Manager:
Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries...
Search for: "TimerOne" and "TimerThree"
```

Or via command line:
```bash
arduino-cli lib install TimerOne
arduino-cli lib install TimerThree
```

### Upload Sketch

1. Open `MouseWiggler.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Select your board: **Tools → Board → Arduino Leonardo** (or Micro)
3. Select your port: **Tools → Port**
4. Click **Upload** ⬆️

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Tuning Detection Sensitivity

Edit these values in [MouseWiggler.ino](MouseWiggler.ino#L57-L65) to match your environment:

```cpp
// Percentage change required to consider a light change "significant"
#define SUDDEN_CHANGE_THRESHOLD  15  // Default: 15%

// Rate of change to distinguish sudden vs gradual changes
#define CHANGE_RATE_THRESHOLD    5   // Default: 5% per sample period
```

**Adjust if needed:**
- **Too sensitive** (triggers on clouds): Increase both thresholds
- **Not sensitive enough** (misses light switch): Decrease both thresholds
- **Getting false triggers**: Increase `CHANGE_RATE_THRESHOLD`

### Other Parameters

```cpp
#define wigglePeriod           10  // Base seconds between wiggles (default: 10s)
#define wigglePeriodVariation   3  // Random variation ±seconds (default: 3s)
#define SizeOfAnalogArray     100  // Sample buffer size (default: 100 samples)
#define HISTORY_SIZE            5  // History depth for rate calculation (default: 5)
```

**Randomization Tuning:**
- **Increase `wigglePeriodVariation`** for more unpredictable timing (harder to detect)
- **Decrease `wigglePeriodVariation`** for more consistent timing
- **Actual range**: (wigglePeriod - variation) to (wigglePeriod + variation) seconds

## 🔍 Debugging

### Serial Monitor

Enable serial debugging to see real-time detection data:

1. Open **Tools → Serial Monitor**
2. Set baud rate to **115200**
3. Observe output:

```
(1000ms) ADC Prior: 45230  ADC Current: 45180  Diff: -50  Change%: -1  Rate%: 0
(2000ms) ADC Prior: 45180  ADC Current: 45200  Diff: 20   Change%: 0   Rate%: 0
(3000ms) ADC Prior: 45200  ADC Current: 67800  Diff: 22600 Change%: 50 Rate%: 10
Lights Detected ON (sudden change)
Need to wiggle the mouse (next in 12s)
Need to wiggle the mouse (next in 8s)
Need to wiggle the mouse (next in 11s)
```

Note the randomized intervals between wiggles (12s, 8s, 11s instead of constant 10s).

### LED Indicator

The optional LED on pin D2:
- **ON** = Light detected, wiggling active
- **OFF** = Dark, screen saver allowed

## 🎓 Algorithm Details

### Rate-of-Change Detection

Traditional approaches use simple threshold detection:
```
if (current > previous + threshold) → trigger
```

**Problem**: Can't distinguish between:
- Fast change: Light switch (want to detect)
- Slow change: Sunset (want to ignore)

**MouseWiggler Solution**: Tracks both magnitude AND velocity:

```cpp
percentChange = (current - previous) / previous * 100
rateOfChange = (current - oldest) / (oldest * historySize) * 100

if (percentChange > 15% AND rateOfChange > 5%) {
    // Sudden change detected!
}
```

This creates a "velocity filter" that only responds to rapid transitions.

### Circular Buffers

The system uses two circular buffers:
1. **AnalogArray[100]**: Raw ADC samples for noise reduction
2. **sumHistory[5]**: Historical averages for rate calculation

Benefits:
- Constant memory usage (no dynamic allocation)
- O(1) insertion time
- Efficient for embedded systems

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wiggler doesn't respond to light changes
- Check photocell connections (use multimeter to verify resistance changes)
- Monitor serial output to see ADC values
- Ensure photocell has adequate light difference (room light vs dark)
- Try decreasing `SUDDEN_CHANGE_THRESHOLD`

### Issue: Too many false triggers
- Increase `CHANGE_RATE_THRESHOLD` to filter slow changes
- Increase `HISTORY_SIZE` for more aggressive rate filtering
- Ensure stable lighting (avoid flickering fluorescent lights)

### Issue: Mouse not recognized
- Verify board has HID support (Leonardo, Micro, etc.)
- Check USB connection
- Ensure `Mouse.begin()` is being called

### Issue: LED always on/off
- Verify LED polarity (cathode to GND)
- Check resistor value (220Ω recommended)
- Monitor serial output to see detected light status
